# Smolov- This program is designed to create a custom four week workout plan based on the users own unique specifications. 

The user will input their max lift on the desired exercise they wish to create a plan for and should begin on week one. Each week calculates weights for fixed sets and reps based on max lift inputted by user. After inputting max lift weight the user can select which week to view so they can return to the program at any time. The program will prompt you to then input what day on the program you would like to view (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday) If the user selects Yes ("1"), the program will display a week by week layout of each day and your progression.
